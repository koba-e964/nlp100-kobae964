## Analysis

1. **Semantic analogy** shows significantly higher accuracy than syntactic analogy
2. **nationality-adjective** has the highest accuracy rate (90%)
3. **currency** has the lowest accuracy rate (0%)
4. Most grammatical transformation tasks (inflection, morphological changes) show very low accuracy
